## Uploading data

First, I need to upload set of data which was the base for the original plot. I copied the tables from publication "*Cotter DJ, et al. (2004) Hematocrit was not validated as a surrogate endpoint for survival among epoetin-treated hemodialysis patients."* and I created proper csv files*.*

```{r}
mortality_ratio<-read.csv("mortality_rate.csv")
hazard_ratio<-read.csv("hazard_ratio.csv")

```

## Plots fixing

Here are the 'bad' plots I want to fix:

![As we can see the plots are really hard to read. ](plots.png)

#### Mortality Rate (per 1,000 patients)

First, make the table mortality_ratio in long format:

```{r}

mortality_ratio_long<-pivot_longer(data=mortality_ratio,
                                   cols=colnames(mortality_ratio)[-1], #pivoted data from all columns except for 1st
                                   values_to = "Ratio", #name of the column contained values of the mortality rate
                                   names_to = "Hematocrit_group") #name of the column contained names of the groups
mortality_ratio_long
```

When we have our table prepared, we can create more readable plot. For that, we can use `geom_bar` function.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mortality_ratio_long, aes(x = Hematocrit_group, fill = Dose_Quartile))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=Ratio), stat = "summary", position = "dodge")+ #creation of bar chart
  labs(title="1-year mortality rates per 1,000 patients, #labels setting
  by hematocrit level and epoetin dose quartile", 
       x="Hematocrit group", 
       y="Mortality Rate (per 1,000 patients)",
       fill = "Dose quartile" )

```

What I changed:

-   change from 3D format to 2D - easier to read

-   data is divided by hematocrit group and each value contains of 4 quartile bars

-   colors are more eye-pleasing

#### Relative risk of death by epoetin dose quartiles as a function of hematocrit level

Fixing the second plot would be similar to the first one. First, table format change:

```{r}
hazard_ratio_long<-pivot_longer(data = hazard_ratio,
                                   cols=colnames(hazard_ratio)[-1], #pivoted data from all columns except for 1st
                                   values_to = "Relative_risk", #name of the column contained values of the ralative risk of death
                                   names_to = "Hematocrit_group") #name of the column contained names of the groups
hazard_ratio_long
```

Again, we can use `geom_bar` function to create better plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = hazard_ratio_long, aes(x = Hematocrit_group, fill = Dose.Quartile))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=Relative_risk), stat = "summary", position = "dodge")+ #creation of bar chart
  labs(title="Relative risk of death by hematocrit group
disaggregated by epoetin dose quartile", #labels setting
       x="Hematocrit group", 
       y="Hazard ratio",
       fill = "Dose quartile" )
```

The changes in plot above are the same as changes in the previous one.

And this is how we can fix 'bad' plots.ðŸ˜Š
